### Deep Learning: a short introduction

<p align="justify">Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning. In the context of machine learning, learning is the process of creating models based on the information extracted from the data that is capable of making predictions on unknown data. Examples of such models are: linear regression, decision trees, support vector machine, artificial neural network, etc. Each model has different parameters that are estimated during the training phase by the learning algorithms. During the training phase, we are trying to learn the best parameters that will make our model predict correctly most of the unknown data. </p>

When this model is an artificial neural network with a larger number of hidden layers (a large depth > 2)  it is called of deep neural network. The process of training it is called **deep learning**.
