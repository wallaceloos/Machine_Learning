The dog breed classification problem has been hostedby Kaggle.  It consists in finding the correct breed for a given dog.  
The low intra-variance presented among some dog breeds and the class imbalance, make this classification problem a challenge.  Besides that, the dataset provided by Kaggle, has only 10222 images, for 120  different  breeds.   In  this  report  we  present three  different  architectures  to  solve  this  multiclass classication problem and also an approach to handle the class imbalance.
