The apparent age estimation is a regression problem established in order to estimate the age apparent and
not the real (or biological) age. In the real age estimation, each image has only one age associated to
the image. In the apparent age estimation, each age can have more than one age associated to the same
image [4]. This is a regression problem since the age is from a continous domain. Some of the applications
of the apparent age estimation are: customer profiling, security, and entertainment[1, 4]. In this report,
we present a simple deep convolutional neural network to estimate the apparent age given the image of
the person.
